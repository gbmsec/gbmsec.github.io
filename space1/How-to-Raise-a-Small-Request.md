 **Small Request**  (SR) is a request to IT to implement some functionality in existing IT services or to add some new functionality to existing IT services. SR is a minor improvement of IT service or services. It’s measured by workload estimation for SR implementation. SR should be capped by 10 MDs of IT workload and impact not more that 1-3 services. In particular cases SR can be accepted for implementation with estimation in more than 10 MDs and impacts more services but this is subjected to the validated of Head of IT Change management. Small request should bear a small risk of impact on operational and business processes. 

New IT service implementation can be processed through SR if its workload estimation is less than 10 MDs and IT Service is not assumed to be business critical or mission critical.

SR are managed in the organisation by Small Request management procedure. Direct link on procedure: [[Small Request Management procedure|Small-Request-Management-procedure]]



Everyone can raise SR by [http://jira/request](http://jira/request)

|  *****  | What is this request for? What is a benefit from implementation of this request ? | Any text | 
|  *****  | What IT service needs to be changed | any registered IT service  | 
|  | Services can be impacted by the change | Multiple items from a list | 
|  *****  | Impact on business and business processes. Requestor needs to assess the risk that his SR will bring on current business processes.  If the risk of change is High that PMO Head on Approval level may take a decision not to approve the change and to recommend to open a Project to implement the request. | Select value from list |
