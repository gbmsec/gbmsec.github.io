## Who can join Teams meetings?
Teams meetings can be joined by both internal (BCS Global Markets colleagues) and external users. Essentially, anyone with the meeting link can join the meeting.

BCS Global Markets colleagues are admitted to the meeting directly.

External users are initially put to the meeting lobby. They have to admitted by someone in BCS Global Markets (logged in with @bcsgm.com account) to fully join the meeting. This can be anyone in the meeting, not just the meeting host.
