For those new to KeePassXC, it is a password manager that will keep all of your sensitive login data in one securely encrypted file, the.kdbx database. KeePassXC is able to integrate with browsers to autofill your logins and comes with added security benefit of not relying on any third-parties/cloud storage.

To start using KeePassXC, you need to first create a database that will store the password and other details.






# Initial setup: creating database

1. Open application home screen and click on 'Create new database' (A)

    (A) Open the password generator

    (B) Toggle password visibility

    

    

 **There is no way to recover forgotten password** , so either make sure it is virtually impossible to forget or note it down somewhere safe!




1. Click 'Done'. You will be prompted to select a location to save your database file:  **save it on your personal network drive **  **(K:)** . The database file is saved on to your computer with the default .kdbx extension and it is fully encrypted at all times preventing unauthorized access

    

    


1. You are now ready to 'Open existing database'. Navigate to the location of the your database on your K:/ drive and open the database file

    

    
1. The database unlock screen will appear. Enter your password and that's it (ignore other optional input fields below password prompt)

# Browser integration



1.  Install KeePassXC extension for Chrome browser [here (link)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk) and/or Microsoft Edge browser [here (link)](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/keepassxcbrowser/pdffhmdngciaglkoonimfcmckehcpafo)

    

    
1. Now head back to KeePassXC application and navigate to Settings > Browser Integration

    

    
    1.  Tick  _'Enable browser integration'_  checkbox in the top
    1.  Then select the browsers for which you have downloaded the extension

    

    

    
1.  While keeping the KeePassXC application open  **and**  unlocked, restart your browser

    

    
1. Click KeePassXC-Browser extension icon in your browser and then click 'Connect' button in the pop-up window

1. You will be prompted to enter a name for your own reference to identify the connection between this browser and your database. Something along the lines 'chrome-pc' or 'edge-laptop' would make sense for each respective browser/device.

    

    

    
1. Restart both applications again, unlock the KeePassXC databse and ensure the KeePassXC browser icon in your web browser is green as shown below  _(C)_ .

     _(A)_  KeePassXC is not running or is disconnected

     _(B)_  Connected to KeePassXC, but database is locked

     _(C)_  Connected to KeePassXC and ready to use

true
