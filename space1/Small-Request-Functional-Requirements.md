A  **Functional Requiremen** t (FR) is a description of the service that the software must offer or a target of SR implementation. To put it simply, functional requirements describe  **what the service should do or a dedicated function of a service should do** . It describes a change to aservice or its component. A function is nothing but inputs to the service, its behavior, and outputs. It can be a calculation, data manipulation, business process, user interaction, or any other specific functionality which defines what function a system is likely to perform.

Functional requirements need to be clear, simple, and unambiguous. 

Service is a registered IT service, full list of services is stored and mainteined in Jira - [http://jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?formId=10&attributeId=0&attributeValue=&selectedProjectId=15900&reportKey=plugin.jip%3Ainventoryreport&atl_token=BPOW-KE0X-F3ZC-45XK_162ec2c4bd9ea76e0f49723b9e3fdfe606183f5d_lin&Next=Next](http://jira/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?formId=10&attributeId=0&attributeValue=&selectedProjectId=15900&reportKey=plugin.jip%3Ainventoryreport&atl_token=BPOW-KE0X-F3ZC-45XK_162ec2c4bd9ea76e0f49723b9e3fdfe606183f5d_lin&Next=Next)

 **Functional Requirements Best-Practices - Be as clear as possible!!!** 

Well-written functional requirements typically have the following characteristics:


*  _Necessary_ . Although functional requirements may have different priority, every one of them needs to relate to a particular business goal or user requirement.
*  **_Concise_** . Use simple and easy-to-understand language without any unnecessary jargon to prevent confusion or misinterpretations.
*  _Attainable_ . All requirements you include need to be realistic within the time and budget constraints set in the business requirements document.
*  **_Granular_** . Do not try to combine many requirements within one. The more precise and granular your requirements are, the easier it is to manage them.
*  _Consistent_ . Make sure the requirements do not contradict each other and use consistent terminology.
*  _Verifiable_ . It should be possible to determine whether the requirement has been met at the end of the project.
* Unclear or confusing requirements can create as many problems as undocumented ones. The scope of the project becomes fuzzy, leading to missed deadlines, unforeseen costs, and wasted effort. Making sure the requirements are documented in a way that leaves no room for interpretation can help you avoid these and many other issues down the road.
